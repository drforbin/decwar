C	This routine builds a low segment variable DBITS which
C	indicates (using individual bits) the active ships within ILIM
C	sectors of the specified location (iV, iH).  IFLAG modifies
C	this command: 0 = all ships, 1 = only federation ships, and
C	2 = only klingon ships.  This routine is used by MAKHIT and
C	GETHIT to determine who should receive a particular hit
C	message.  If ZERO = 0, then DBITS is initially set to 0.
