C	This routine allows a ship to tow another friendly ship.  The
C	deflector shields of both ships must be down.  Incoming torpedo
C	hits or nova damage breaks the tractor beam, as does raising
C	either ship's deflector shields.  The entry point TRCOFF is
C	used to break an active tractor beam.
