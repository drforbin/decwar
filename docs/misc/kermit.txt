Transfering files between simh and UNIX using K10MIT 3(136)

This document describes how to transfer files back and forth between UNIX and 
TOPS-10 using kermit and the simh DZ11 terminal emulation support.

Requirements:
1. a working copy of the simh pdp10 emulator (simh.trailing-edge.com)
2. A copy of TOPS10 with K10MIT installed on it 
(www.steubentech.com/~talon/pdp10)
3. A copy of C-Kermit (http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ck80.html)


Getting started:

I am assuming that you have read all teh documentation for simh and for my 
TOPS-10 distribution so that you can now easily log in over telnet

(if not try running
set dz 8b
at -am dz 2020

as part of the simh setup)

Once you have the simh booting tops10 and tops10 listening ot port 202 for 
terminal connections. 

build the C-Kermit source on the UNIX machine and you will get a binary called 
wermit

Execute the wermit binary to get a screen somewhat like this:
C-Kermit 8.0.211, 10 Apr 2004, for Solaris 8
 Copyright (C) 1985, 2004,
  Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.
Type ? or HELP for help.
(/opt/home/talon/kermit/cobol/) C-Kermit>

Type set host <hostname> 2020 /raw-socket to connect to the emulator

Example:
(/opt/home/talon/kermit/cobol/) C-Kermit>set host ayeka 2020 /raw-socket
 DNS Lookup...  Trying 192.168.93.50...  Reverse DNS Lookup... (OK)
 ayeka connected on port 2020
(/opt/home/talon/kermit/cobol/) C-Kermit>

Type c to get to the login prompt

Example:
(/opt/home/talon/kermit/cobol/) C-Kermit>c
Connecting to host ayeka:2020
 Escape character: Ctrl-\ (ASCII 28, FS): enabled
Type the escape character followed by C to get back,
or followed by ? to see other options.
----------------------------------------------------

Connected to the PDP-10 simulator

Hit return until you get a '.' character then type login public.



Example:
.login public
Job 3  VNW  TTY0
20:02   23-Oct-6   Monday

.

Run K10MIT to send/receive files on the tops-10 end
Example (BEWARE be sure to type teh set file byte-size
line unless you like transferring garbage instead of real data):
.r k10mit

TOPS-10 KERMIT version 3(136)
Kermit-10>set file byte-size 36-bit
Kermit-10>

Downloading files from TOPS-10:
Simply type send filename from the Kermit-10 prompt

Uploading files to TOPS-10:
This is a bit more involved
make sure you are at the Kermit-10 prompt and type Receive filename
You won't get a prompt back and it will just sit there. thats just what we want.
The next step is to escape back into C-Kermit by typing Control-\c (hit control and \ and then type c and possibly a carrage return)

You should now be back to the 
C-Kermit> prompt
Example:
(Back at ayeka)
----------------------------------------------------
(/opt/home/talon/kermit/cobol/) C-Kermit>

once there its as simple as typing send filename

finally to quit kermit go back to tops-10 and exit out of K10MIT, log out by typing kjob and then escape back to C-Kermit and type quit and say yes when it asks if you want to disconnect.


As a final note you can actually transmit binarys back and forth and it works just fine. just be sure to set file byte-size 36-bit in Kermit-10>

test.exe in this distribution makes a great test of this ability.
