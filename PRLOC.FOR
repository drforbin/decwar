C	This routine prints out a sector location (v,h) in the form
C	v-h.  A carriage return suffixes this print line if prcflg
C	is non-zero.  w should be either 2 or 0 (free format).  Prlflg
C	determines whether to output relative, absolute, or both
C	coordinates (usually OCFLG, but sometimes KABS).  Proflg
C	determines whether to output in the short, medium, or long
C	format (usually oflg, but sometimes SHORT).
