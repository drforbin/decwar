C	This routine is used to fortify captured planets against enemy
C	assault, and eventually to transform them into fully operational
C	starbases.  Each build strengthens the planetary phaser banks,
C	with five accumulated 'builds' transforming the planet into a
C	starbase (if your team possesses less than the maximum number
C	of operational starbases at that time).
