.Introduction
Introduction and Overview of the Game of DECWARs.

     DECWAR is a real time space  battle  game  designed  to  be
played  by  from  1  to 10 people.  The object of the game is to
destroy all  enemy  bases  and  ships,  and  capture  all  enemy
planets,  before  the  enemy  does the same to you.  Each person
plays on a separate terminal, and enters the game by selecting

               8 DECWAR (on the MultiPlayer Host)

Players are free to enter and leave the game as  desired,  since
each  has  his  own  job  and therefore won't interfere with the
other players  (the  jobs  interact  through  a  shareable  high
segment).


     Besides the enemy (Federation or Empire), the following may
also be a threat to your well being.

     1.  Romulans are nasty beasts that beginners are better off
         without.   However,  if you're the only person playing,
         the Romulan is your only competition.  Romulans tend to
         make  for  shorter  games  but when there are 3 or less
         players a Romulan will be included.  After  the  fourth
         player joins the game, a Romulan will not be re-created
         once he is destroyed.  include Romulans in the game.

     2.  Black holes are annoying, since if  you  are  displaced
         into  one,  you're  dead.   They also tend to gobble up
         stray torpedos.  There is a 25% chance of  black  holes
         being included in the game.


     There are two primary opposing  forces  in  the  galaxy  --
Humans  (Federation)  and  Klingons  (Empire).  As you enter the
game for the first time, you get to  choose  which  side  you'll
join  (unless there is a large imbalance in the team sizes).  If
you are subsequently destroyed and later reenter the  game,  you
automatically rejoin your old team.

     You get to select the ship you want to control from a  list
of  remaining  ships  on  your  side.  There are 5 ships on each
side:

             Federation ships               Empire ships
             ----------------               ------------
                Lexington                     Cobra
                Nimitz                        Demon
                Savannah                      Hawk
                Vulcan                        Jackal
                Yorktown                      Wolf



     Due to continuous espionage activities, present  front-line
ships  of the Federation and the Klingon Empire are identical in
strength and weaponry.  These ships  can  move  from  sector  to
sector  using  either  warp or impulse engines, can attack enemy
installations  and  ships  using  either  photon  torpedoes   or
phasers,  and  can  defend  themselves against such attack using
their deflector  shields.   All  ships  also  possess  sub-space
radios  which  keep  them  in  touch with friendly starbases and
other ships.


     The various devices of a ship are subject to damage.   This
damage  may  be  due  to  enemy  attack  or  to over use.  These
damages, unlike total ship damage (see ship  attributes  below),
may  be  repaired while underway.  If damage on a device is less
than 300 units, its performance is degraded.  If damage  is  300
or  more units, the device is inoperative.  A ship possesses the
following devices:

     1.  Warp Engines -- These engines are the  normal  mode  of
         travel for starships.  The maximum speed is warp factor
         6, with warps 5 and 6 risking potential damage  to  the
         engines.   If  warp  engines are damaged (less than 300
         units) the maximum speed is warp factor 3.


                                  NOTE

             One warp unit is equivalent to  one  horizontal
             or  one  vertical  grid  movement.   A diagonal
             movement is equivalent to the hypotenuse of the
             horizontal and vertical sides.



     2.  Impulse Engines --  These  engines  are  basically  for
         emergency  use  while  the  warp engines are critically
         damaged.  Impulse engines move the ship at warp  factor
         1.

     3.  Photon Torpedo Tubes -- Used to fire photon  torpedoes.
         If  these  tubes  are  damaged, the accuracy of torpedo
         bursts is impaired.  The maximum torpedo  range  is  10
         sectors.

     4.  Phaser Banks -- Each ship possesses two  phaser  banks,
         with  a  single  phaser control.  Damage to this phaser
         control or to the ship's computer reduces the  strength
         of the phaser hit.

     5.  Deflector Shields -- The deflector shields  of  a  ship
         protect  it  from damage from phaser and photon torpedo
         hits, and shield it from the  energy  released  when  a
         star  goes nova.  The percent shield strength indicates
         the  percent  of  the  incoming  hit  which   will   be
         nullified.   In  addition, strong deflector shields may
         deflect photon torpedoes  with  little  or  no  damage.
         NOTE:  If a ship's shields are up, the amount of energy
         expended during movement is doubled.
     6.  Computer -- The ship's computer is  used  for  computed
         firing,  computation  during  ship  movement,  and  for
         phaser  control.   If  the  computer  is   inoperative,
         navigation  during  warp  and  impulse movement becomes
         inexact.

     7.  Life Support -- If the life support units of a starship
         are  inoperative,  the  ship  must  either  repair this
         damage or dock within 5  stardates.   If  this  is  not
         accomplished, the crew will die.

     8.  Sub-Space Radio --  The  sub-space  radio  is  used  to
         communicate  with  other  ships, of either side.  Bases
         under attack also use the sub-space radio to  call  for
         help   and   notify   their   team's   ships  of  their
         destruction.

     9.  Tractor  Beam  --  The  ship's  tractor  beam  is  used
         primarily  to  tow  damaged  friendly  ships  away from
         danger.  The beam can not be  used  unless  both  ships
         have lowered their shields.


     In addition to the individual devices  discussed  above,  a
newly  commissioned  ship (or a fully repaired and rearmed older
ship) possesses the following attributes:

     1.  5000 units of ship energy.  Ship energy is used  during
         movement  and phaser firing.  It is also decreased each
         time  the  ship  gets  hit  with  phasers   or   photon
         torpedoes.   If  this  quantity  ever reaches zero, the
         ship is dead.  A ship possessing  1000  units  of  ship
         energy  or less automatically goes to yellow alert, and
         a warning bell sounds after every move.

     2.  2500 units of shield energy.  This energy is stored  in
         the  ship's  shields  (whether  up  or  down),  and  is
         separate from the ship energy.  However, energy may  be
         transferred   between  these  two  energy  reserves  as
         needed.  If shields are up, their energy  is  decreased
         each time the ship gets hit.

     3.  Zero units of  ship  damage.   During  battle,  a  ship
         collects  hits  from enemy installations and ships.  If
         these accumulated hits ever reach 2500 units of  damage
         or  greater, the ship is destroyed.  Ship damage may be
         reduced only by docking.


     The galaxy is arranged in a  grid  of  75  by  75  sectors.
Players  can  move  freely  throughout  the  galaxy in search of
enemies, which come in several categories:

     1.  Romulan.  This can be the most dangerous thing to  come
         up  against,  and  fortunately  there is a maximum of 1
         Romulan in the game at any  given  time.   The  Romulan
         moves  around concealed by his cloaking device until he
         comes across a suitable target  (Federation  or  Empire
         ship  or base) which he immediately proceeds to attack.
         An infinite supply of torpedoes and energy make  him  a
         formidable   foe.    If  you  kill  one,  another  will
         eventually appear somewhere in the galaxy.

     2.  Enemy ship.  This is the second most dangerous thing to
         come  across, since all enemy ships are backed by human
         intelligence.  All ships are created equal, and so  the
         outcome  of a clash between two ships is usually due to
         skill  on  its  captain's  part,  although  some  other
         factors do come into play.

     3.  Enemy base.  These aren't  dangerous  unless  you  come
         within  range  (4 sectors) since they are immobile.  If
         you ARE foolish enough to get  within  range,  however,
         their  overwhelming phaser power will quickly pound you
         into rubble!  Destroying a  base  is  useful  primarily
         because  this  removes it from use by your enemy (bases
         are used as supply stations and as a refuge in times of
         stress).   A  damaged starbase will slowly build itself
         back  to  full  strength  if  it  is   not   completely
         destroyed.

     4.  Enemy planet.  These are just like enemy bases,  except
         that  they  are  weaker (how much weaker depends on how
         many fortifications the enemy has built on  them),  and
         they  can  be captured.  Their firing range is only two
         sectors, and they can re-supply the enemy less  rapidly
         than can a base.

     5.  Neutral planet.  While these aren't strictly classified
         as  enemies,  they  will  take  pot shots at you (their
         range is also 2 sectors), so be wary of them.  You  can
         capture neutral planets and win them over to your side.



     When playing the game, all commands can be abbreviated to 2
characters,  and some can be abbreviated to 1 character (you can
use the shortest  unambiguous  abbreviation).   For  a  list  of
commands type

         HELP *

and for a description of an individual command type

         HELP command

The help on individual commands will be read from this help file
(that's  what  the  periods  in  column  1  are  for in the long
description of each command).  The legal commands are:

     1.  BASES -- List information on friendly and  known  enemy
         bases.

     2.  BUILD  --  Develop  installations  on  a  planet,   and
         eventually build it into a base.  The planet must first
         be captured.

     3.  CAPTURE -- Win a neutral or enemy planet over  to  your
         side.
     4.  DAMAGES --  List  damaged  devices  and  their  current
         status.

     5.  *DEBUG -- A password-controlled routine  to  enter  DDT
         directly from DECWAR.

     6.  DOCK -- Dock at  an  adjacent  base  or  planet.   This
         increases  your  energy,  replenishes  your  torpedoes,
         repairs your ship  a  little,  and  reduces  your  ship
         damage.

     7.  ENERGY -- Transfer energy between two ships.

     8.  GRIPE -- Record bugs, comments,  suggestion,  etc.   in

         or restore communications from individual ships.

    20.  REPAIR -- Repair your damaged devices a little.

    21.  SCAN -- Display the galaxy with the default  range  set
         to  maximum  (10  sectors  in  each direction from your
         ship).

    22.  SET -- Set various input and output defaults.

    23.  SHIELDS -- Transfer energy to  or  from  your  shields;
         raise or lower your shields.

    24.  SRSCAN -- Display the galaxy with a default range of  7
         sectors (1 greater than the maximum warp factor).

         about the players currently in the game.



. .INPUT
General INPUT information

- Only the first 5 characters of each  input  word  are  stored.
  Any characters beyond that are ignored.
- Input words may be separated by spaces, tabs, or commas.
- The input line can be terminated with <CR>, <LF>, <VT>,  <FF>,
  <ESC>, or ^Z.
- ^G toggles echo.  At the beginning of each input line, echoing
  is  turned  on.   Typing ^G turns it off, the next ^G turns it
  back on, etc.  Echoing is always turned back on at the end  of
  an input line, or if ^U is typed.
- Multiple commands may be given on a  single  command  line  by
  separating  the  commands with / (slash).  If the TELL command
  is given, it must be last on the line.
- Anything after ;  (semicolon) is treated as a comment  and  is
  ignored  (but  TELL  rescans the line and takes the text after
  the first ;  as the message to send).
- <ESC> (escape, or altmode) entered as the first  character  in
  response  to  the  command  prompt (even before ^H, ^U, or ^R)
  repeats the previous command.  This is useful when building  a
  planet,  docking,  repairing,  firing torpedoes, etc.  Altmode
  can't be used to repeat a TELL command.

- Any ship name can be abbreviated to 1 character.
- Any command or  keyword  can  be  shortened  to  the  shortest
  unambiguous   abbreviation,   which   is  never  more  than  2
  characters.

- Many commands require a coordinate as  an  argument  (PHASERS,
  TORPEDOES,  CAPTURE, BUILD, etc.).  The required coordinate(s)
  can be specified in one of three ways:
  Absolute - the default coordinate input type, which is  simply
    an  absolute  vertical  position  followed  by  an  absolute
    horizontal position.  The coordinate may be preceded by  the
    keyword  ABSOLUTE,  but  this  isn't  necessary  unless  the
    default coordinate input type has been changed by SET  ICDEF
    RELATIVE.
  Relative -  the  keyword  RELATIVE,  followed  by  a  relative
    vertical  distance  and  a  relative horizontal distance.  A
    positive distance is either up or  right,  and  negative  is
    either down or left.  The absolute coordinate is computed by
    adding the relative distances to your current position.  The
    keyword  RELATIVE  isn't  needed  if  the default coordinate
    input type has been changed by SET ICDEF RELATIVE.
  Computed - the keyword COMPUTED followed by a ship name.   The
    coordinate  used  is  the  location of the given ship.  This
    type of coordinate computation is available only to captains
    controlling  their  ships  through  slow  terminals  (< 1200
    baud), and requires an operational computer.
    * If the password is set you can  use  computed  coordinates
      even on a fast terminal.
  The keyword ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE, or COMPUTED is only given  one
  time  for  each set of coordinates.  For instance, the TORPEDO
  command can accept  up  to  3  coordinates,  but  the  keyword
  describing  the  coordinate input type is given only once, and
  all coordinates must be of the same type.
.
.OUTPUT
General OUTPUT information

The SET OUTPUT LONG/MEDIUM/SHORT command controls the length  of
text output throughout the game.  In particular, Medium or Short
hit messages received  during  battle  are  greatly  reduced  in
length  when  compared to the Long format.  Unfortunately, these
shorter forms are not as self-explanatory as the Long form.  The
following  are  some  equivalent  Long,  Medium  and  Short  hit
messages:

- Goblin @22-31, +83.6%  makes 285.3 unit torpedo hit on
  Vulcan displaced to 20-31, +72.1%

  G @22-31, +83.6%  285.3 unit T  V -->20-31, +72.1%

  G 22-31 +83  285T  V >20-31 +72


- Emp planet(3) @15-16 makes 155.5 unit phaser hit on
  Buzzard @15-17, 66.8%

  -@3 @15-16  155.5 unit P  B @15-17, 66.8%

  -@3 15-16  155P  B 15-17 +66

  Note: The -@3 indicates an Empire planet built 3 times.


- Star @22-31 +4,+2 makes 301.2 unit hit on
  Panther displaced to 20-31 +2,+2, -72.1%

  * @22-31 +4,+2  301.2 unit N  P -->20-31 +2,+2, -72.1%

  * 22-31 +4,+2  301N P >20-31 +2,+2, -72

  Note:  The relative coordinates appear due to a SET OCDEF BOTH
  command.  The Panther's shields are 72.1% of max strength, but
  down (-72.1%).

.PREGAME
The Decwar PRE-GAME feature

DECWAR provides a Pre-game feature to allow:
- New players to view the help file without entering the current
  game.
- Experienced players to check the  status  of  a  current  game
  before choosing a side and ship.
- Players to submit Gripes without entering the game.

The commands currently active within the Pre-game section are:
Activate  Gripe     Help      News      Points    Quit
Summary   Time      Users

The ACTIVATE command (valid only in the  pre-game)  is  used  to
exit the pre-game section and enter the normal ship setup stage.
The pre-game can be recognized from the 'PG>' command prompt.
.
.HINTS
Some general HINTS

- When in doubt, use the on-line help system.  See the  help  on
  HELP for more information.
- If the output starts piling up in the middle of a battle, type
  ^O  (CTL-O).   None  of  your  commands will be executed until
  output is finished, so it's sometimes better  just  to  ignore
  the  hit  messages  so  your  attack  or  run  commands can be
  executed immediately.
- Use multiple commands per line  (separate  commands  with  /).
  Once  you're  in  a danger area, things can happen faster than
  you can react to them.  Plan your action ahead of time, before
  you enter a danger area.
- If some unexpected action happens, such as  an  enemy  finding
  you,  and  you  have  several  stacked commands (either from a
  multiple command line or typing ahead), type ^C to  abort  all
  stacked  commands  (especially  if  it involves time consuming
  commands such as BUILD, or commands that  generate  a  lot  of
  output,  such  as  SCAN).   You can then proceed to remedy the
  situation by giving your unexpected visitor a good beating.
- If you're on a slow terminal, use  computed  coordinates,  and
  move  around  a  lot  if  you're  fighting  someone  on a fast
  terminal.  Computed coordinates are the primary advantage slow
  terminals  have  over the fast ones (computed coordinates give
  slow  terminals  a  fantastic  tactical  advantage  over  fast
  terminals when used properly).
- Use <ESC> to repeat commands (see the help on  ESCAPE).   It's
  just a convenience when building planets, etc., but in battle,
  and combined with multiple commands per line  and/or  computed
  coordinates  (such  as PH C B/M R 1 0  or  TO 1 32 45), it can
  make or break your career as a starship captain.
- Don't get within range of an  enemy  base,  unless  you  enjoy
  being  pounded  into rubble.  You can kill a base just as well
  from 1 sector outside it's range (use the WARNING  keyword  on
  SCAN to see the range of an enemy base).
- Don't waste your energy and torpedoes firing at friendly ships
  and  bases.   If you're not sure if it's friendly or not, type
  HELP SCAN for a list of what's what.  You  can  also  use  the
  TARGETS  command  to  see which enemies are lurking about (see
  the help on TARGETS and LIST).
- Don't make it a  habit  of  sitting  next  to  stars;   photon
  torpedoes  can  turn  them  into  novas,  which  are extremely
  destructive.  Conversely, if you notice an enemy ship or  base
  adjacent to a star, take advantage of the situation!
- One sure way to locate enemy  ships  is  to  watch  for  newly
  captured enemy planets by using the PLANETS or LIST command.
- In general, don't waste photon torpedoes battering at a target
  with  85-100%  shields.   The  chances are good that they will
  just be deflected harmlessly away.  Use your phasers to weaken
  the  shields,  then  use torpedoes to finish him off.  This is
  especially true when attempting to destroy an enemy starbase.
- Use the SET command in DECWAR.INI to personalize the output to
  your  own  tastes.   That way you'll be guaranteed to have the
  output set right each time you play a game.
- To always see the range and direction of any object listed (in
  hit  messages,  output from the LIST command, etc.), SET OCDEF
  BOTH.  (The range is the magnitude of either delta v or  delta
  h, whichever is larger.)

.PAUSES
Commands that take real time

Many of the commands are designed to take a  certain  amount  of
real  time.   This  is done to help equalize the game when there
are different speed terminals and different speed typists in the
game.   Some  commands  take a constant amount of time, and some
are based on the speed of the slowest terminal in the game.

BUILD           5 to 7 seconds
CAPTURE         5 seconds + 1 second for each BUILD of enemy
                planet
DOCK            2 to 4 seconds
IMPULSE         2 to 4 seconds
MOVE            2 to 4 seconds
REPAIR          (0.08 * repair size) seconds (* 0.5 if docked)

You have 2 phaser banks, each of which must be cooled off  after
it's  fired before it can be used again.  Each phaser bank takes
3 to 6 seconds plus the amount of phaser damage /  100  to  cool
off.   For  instance,  if  there  was a 300 baud terminal in the
game, and your phasers had 200 units of  damage,  each  of  your
phaser  banks  would  take  6  + 2 = 8 seconds to cool off after
being fired.  Therefore, you could fire once every 4 seconds, or
twice every 8 seconds.

After each burst of torpedoes the tubes must be reloaded  before
being  used  again.   It takes 2 to 4 seconds plus the amount of
torpedo tube damage / 100 to load a torpedo.  For  instance,  if
there  was  a  300 baud terminal in the game, your torpedoes had
200 units of damage, and you had  just  fired  3  torpedoes,  it
would  take  3  *  (4  +  2)  = 18 seconds before you could fire
torpedoes again.
.


.CTL-C
Use of ^C

If you're in command input wait (DECWAR is waiting  for  you  to
type  a command), typing a ^C will abort the game and return you
to monitor mode.  When you abort the game in this  manner,  your
ship  is  returned  to the pool of available ships.  You will be
able to continue unless a new player  has  taken  your  ship  or
someone has moved into the spot you occupied.

If you're not in a command input wait state when  you  type  ^C,
any  stacked  commands (commands that you typed in ahead of time
that haven't been executed yet) will be aborted, and a series of
bells will be output.

NOTE:  A ship under RED alert conditions can not be returned  to
the monitor level except by using the QUIT command.
.
.BASES
List various BASE information

Syntax:  BAses [<keywords>]

List location and shield percent of friendly bases;  location of
known  enemy  bases;   or count of bases of either side within a
specified range or the entire galaxy.  The default range is  the
entire galaxy, and the default side is friendly bases only.  See
the help for LIST for more information and the complete  set  of
keywords that can be used to modify BASES output.

Examples:

BA              List location and shield percent of all friendly
                bases.
BA ENEMY        List location of all known enemy bases.
BA SUM          Give summary of all friendly bases.
BA ALL SUM      Give summary of all bases.
BA CL           List the location and shield percent of the
                closest friendly base.
BA 34 26        List the location and shield percent of friendly
                base at 34-26 (it doesn't have to be friendly,
                but you can't see the shield percent of an out
                of range enemy base).
.


.BUILD
BUILD fortifications on a captured planet

Syntax:  BUild [Absolute|Relative] <vpos> <hpos>

A  fortified  planet  hits  harder  and  is  more  resistant  to
destruction  by the enemy.  A planet can normally be built up to
4 times.  As  your  team's  starbases  are  destroyed  by  enemy
action,  a  fifth  build will complete the construction of a new
starbase on the planet.  Only 10 starbases can be functional  at
any one time.

Examples:

BU 32 12        Build the planet at sector 32-12.
BU A 32 12      Equivalent to "BU 32 12"
BU R 1 1        Build the planet at sector 32-12, if your
                present location is 31-11.
.


.CAPTURE
CAPTURE a neutral or enemy planet

Syntax:  CApture [Absolute|Relative] <vpos> <hpos>

At the start of the game, all planets are neutral (they fire  at
everyone!).   Once  captured  by  either side, they fire only at
enemy ships, and can be DOCKed at to refuel and rearm, just like
a  base (except a planet can only supply half the resources that
a  base  can).   Enemy  planets  can  also  be  captured.   When
capturing an enemy planet, 1 second is added to the normal pause
time of 5 seconds for each BUILD present.   Also,  50  units  of
ship energy are lost for each build.

Examples:

CA 12 32        Capture planet at 12-32.
CA A 12 32      Equivalent to "CA 12 32".
CA R 1 1        Capture planet at sector 12-32, if your present
                location is 11-31.
.


.DAMAGES
DAMAGE report

Syntax:  DAmages [<device names>]

List damaged ship devices and the amount of damage to each.  The
condition  of  all  or  just  selected  devices may be examined.
Total ship damage is not reported.

Examples:

DA              List all damaged devices and their current
                damages.
DA SH T         List damages for SHields and Torpedo tubes.
DA PH RA C      List damages for PHasers, sub-space RAdio, and
                Computer.
.


.*DEBUG
DEBUG the game

If DDT is loaded:
  Chain to DDT to allow variables to be  examined  and  altered,
  set break points, etc.  To get back to DECWAR, type C.$G.
If DDT is not loaded:
  Exit to the monitor.  If a symbol file is  present,  variables
  can  still  be  easily  examined  by  entering DDT through the
  monitor command DDT.
.


.DOCK
DOCK at a friendly base or planet

Syntax:  DOck [Status [<device names>]]

Refuel, repair,  and  rearm  your  ship,  and  set  your  ship's
condition  to green.  While docked, any repairs are accelerated,
and you have an "infinite" supply of  torps.   If  you  have  no
damages  and  are  completely refueled and rearmed, DOCKing will
have no effect on your ship.  A STATUS  command  string  can  be
appended to a DOCK order.  The following table lists the maximum
resources available per move when DOCKing at a base or planet:

Resource                        Base    Planet
----------------------------------------------
Ship energy                    +1000      +500
Shield energy                   +500      +250
Photon Torpedoes                 +10        +5
Life Support Reserves             +5        +5
Ship Damage                     -100       -50
Ship Damage, if already docked  -200      -100

Examples:

DO              Dock, no status report.
DO ST           Dock, show ship's status AFTER docking.
DO ST SH T      Dock, show ship's shield strength and number of
                torpedos on board AFTER docking.
.


.ENERGY
Transfer ENERGY to a friendly ship

Syntax:  Energy <ship name> <units of energy to transfer>

The receiving ship must be located in an adjacent  sector.   10%
of  the  energy  transferred  will  be  lost  due  to  broadcast
dissipation.  If you attempt to send more energy than the  other
ship  can store (ie 5000 units), the transfer will automatically
be reduced to the maximum possible.

Example:

E I 1000        Transfer 1000 units of energy to the Intrepid.
                The Intrepid will receive 900 units of energy.
.


.GRIPE
Submit a GRIPE

Syntax:  Gripe

Add a comment, bug report, suggestion, etc.  to the top of  file
GAM:DECWAR.GRP.   Type in your comments, then ^Z (CTL-Z) to exit
and continue the game, or ^C (CTL-C) to abort and not  send  the
gripe.   Each  gripe is preceded with a header that includes the
version number, date, time, ship name,  user  name,  TTY  speed,
PPN,  TTY number, job number, and whether or not Romulans and/or
black holes are included in the game.  Unless you are  currently
under  red  alert, GRIPE will protect you from enemy attack.  To
view gripes not yet acted upon, type  the  file  GAM:DECWAR.GRP.
To  view answered gripes, and see what action was taken on them,
type the file GAM:DECWAR.FXD.
.


.HELP
Give HELP

Syntax:  Help [*|<keywords>]

Give general help info, a  list  of  available  commands,  or  a
detailed description of a particular command or keyword.  Unless
you are under red  alert,  HELP  will  protect  you  from  enemy
attack.   The  following  conventions  are  used in the detailed
descriptions:
- The first line contains, in all caps, the keyword that help is
  being given for.
- The syntax line (second line) lists the portion of the keyword
  required  to  make it unique in caps, and the remainder of the
  keyword in lower case, followed  by  any  parameters  (if  the
  keyword is a command).
- A quantity to be filled in is lower case and  enclosed  in  <>
  (angle brackets).
- Optional parameters are enclosed in [] (square brackets).
- A choice (either or) is indicated by | (vertical bar).
- Any parameter that must be typed in literally  is  started  in
  capital  letters  and continued in lower case.  The upper case
  letters signal  the  shortest  unambiguous  abbreviation  (the
  shortest   abbreviation  may  change  slightly,  depending  on
  context).

Examples:

H               Give general help info.
H *             List all available commands.
H H             List this block of text.
H SH            Give help for the SHIELDS command.
H HI G          Give some general HINTS and a description of the
                GRIPE command.
.


.IMPULSE
Move using IMPULSE engines

Syntax:  Impulse [Absolute|Relative] <vpos> <hpos>

Move  one  sector  vertically,   horizontally,   or   diagonally
(equivalent to warp factor 1).  Ship condition changes to green.

Examples:

I 37 45         Move to sector 37-45.
I A 37 45       Equivalent to "I 37 45".
I R 1 -1        Move to sector 37-45, if your ship's present
                location is 36-46.
.


.LIST
LIST ship, base, and planet info

Syntax:  List [<keywords>]

The following information is available via the LIST command:
- Name  of  any  ship  currently  in  the  game  (including  the
  Romulan).
- Location and shield percent of any friendly ship, or any  ship
  within scan range (10 sectors).
- Location and shield percent of any friendly base, or any  base
  within range.
- Location of any known enemy base (any base that has previously
  been SCANned or LISTed by anyone on your team).
- Location and number of builds of  any  known  planet,  or  any
  planet within range.
* Note:  If the password flag is  set,  all  ships,  bases,  and
  planets  are  "known" about.  So, with the password set, LIST,
  SUMMARY, BASES, PLANETS, and TARGETS will allow you access  to
  any  information  they are capable of providing.  However, any
  information received because of the password being set is  not
  "remembered"  like  information  learned through normal use of
  these commands.
The above information is also available, in whole  or  in  part,
through the SUMMARY, BASES, PLANETS, and TARGETS commands.  Each
command has it's own default range,  side  (Federation,  Empire,
Romulan,  Neutral),  and object (ship, base, planet).  LIST (and
SUMMARY) include everything  (infinite  range,  all  sides,  all
objects)  by default.  On output, enemy objects are flagged with
* (star) in column 1 unless the command is TARGETS.

Keywords used with BASES, PLANETS, TARGETS,  LIST,  and  SUMMARY
(not all keywords are legal for all commands):

ship names      Include only specified ships (several ship names
                may be given, including Romulan).

.MOVE
MOVE using warp drive

Syntax:  Move [Absolute|Relative|Computed] <vpos> <hpos>

Maximum speed is warp factor 6, which will move  you  6  sectors
per  turn.  Maximum SAFE speed is warp factor 4;  warp factors 5
and 6 risk potential warp engine damage.  Energy consumption per
move  is  proportional to the square of the warp factor.  If the
ship's  shields  are  up  during  this  movement,   the   energy
consumption is doubled.  Moving changes your ship's condition to
green.

Examples:

M 37 45         Move to sector 37-45.
M A 37 45       Equivalent to "M 37 45".
M R 4 -5        Move to sector 37-45, if your present location
                is 33-50 (move up 4 sectors and left 5 sectors).
M C W           "Ram" the Wolf.  No actual collision occurs, but
                your ship ends up adjacent to the Wolf's current
                position.
.


.NEWS
Display the NEWS file

Syntax:  NEws

Display the file which contains information on any new features,
enhancements, bug fixes, etc for each version of DECWAR.
.


.*PASSWORD
Set PASSWORD

Syntax:  *Password [<password>]

If the correct password is given, set the password flag.  If  no
password  is given, or the password is incorrect, issue an error
message and clear the flag.  The password flag must  be  set  to
access  system  commands (*DEBUG).  Also, with the password flag
set, you have access to ANY information that  LIST  can  supply,
including detailed information on out of range enemy forces.  It
is suggested that you turn off  echoing  by  typing  ^G  (CTL-G)
before  you  type  in  any system command, and especially before
typing in the password.
.


.PHASERS
Fire PHASERS at an enemy ship, base, or planet

Syntax:  PHasers  [Absolute|Relative|Computed]  [energy]  <vpos>
<hpos>

Phasers must be directed at a  specific  target,  and  only  one
target may be specified per command.  Obstacles seemingly in the
path of the phaser blast are unaffected, since the energy ray is
not  a  line-of- sight weapon.  The size of the hit is inversely
proportional to the distance from the target.  Maximum range  is
10 sectors vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  Each phaser
blast consumes 200 units  of  ship  energy,  unless  a  specific
amount  of energy is given (the specified energy must be between
50 and 500 units, inclusive).  The phaser banks have  roughly  a
5%  chance  of  damage with a default (200 unit) blast, with the
probability of damage reaching nearly 65% with  a  maximum  (500
unit)  blast.   The  severity  of  the  resulting damage is also
dependant on the size  of  the  blast.   Also,  if  your  ship's
shields  are  up, a high-speed shield control is used to quickly
lower and then  restore  the  shields  during  the  fire.   This
procedure  consumes  another  200  units  of  ship  energy.  The
weapons officer on board your ship will cancel all phaser blasts
directed  against  friendly  ships,  bases,  or planets.  Firing
phasers (or getting hit by  phasers)  puts  you  on  red  alert.
NOTE:  Although phasers can damage enemy planetary installations
(BUILDs), they can NOT destroy the planet itself.

Examples:

PH 12 32        Phaser target at sector 12-32.
PH A 12 32      Equivalent to "PH 12 32".
PH R 2 -3       Phaser target at sector 12-32, if your location
                is 10-35.
PH C BUZZARD    Phaser the Buzzard (if in range).
PH C B          Same as PH C BUZZARD (ship names can be
                abbreviated to 1 character).
PH 300 12 32    Phaser target at sector 12-32, using 300 units
                of energy.
.


.PLANETS
List various PLANET information

Syntax:  PLanets [<keywords>]

List location and number of builds for all known planets, and  a
summary  of  planets  within  a  specified  range  or the entire
galaxy.  The default range is 10 sectors, and the  default  side
is  every  side.  See the help for LIST for more information and
the complete set of keywords that can be used to modify  PLANETS
output.

Examples:

PL              List all planets within 10 sectors.
PL SUM          Give summary of all planets in game.
PL ALL NEU      List all known neutral planets.
PL ALL CAP      List all known captured planets.
PL ALL 20       List all known planets within a radius of 20
                sectors.
.


.POINTS
List POINTS scored so far this game

Syntax:                                                   POints
[Me|I|Federation|Human|Empire|Klingon|Romulan|All]

Itemize  the  current  point  breakdown.   Information  can   be
obtained  concerning  the points scored by your individual ship,
your team, the opposition, the romulans, or any  combination  of
the  above.   If the Romulan Empire is not involved in the game,
the ROMULAN keyword will be ignored.

Categories in POINTS breakdown:
- Damage to enemies.
- Enemies destroyed (500 points each).
- Damage to bases.
- Planets captured (100 points each).
- Bases built (1000 points each).
- Romulans damaged/destroyed.
- Stars destroyed (-50 points each).
- Planets destroyed (-100 points each).

- Total points scored.
- Total number of ships commissioned.
- Total score / number of players.
- Total score / stardates.

Examples:

PO              List points for your ship.
PO ME           Equivalent to "PO".
PO KLI FED      List the score of the two teams.
PO ALL          List all the scoring information available.
.


.QUIT
QUIT the game

Syntax:  Quit

Quit the game before normal end of execution and return  to  the
monitor.   Your  ship  is  released  for  use by another player,
you're chalked up as just  one  more  casualty,  and  you  can't
CONTINUE  the game.  If you want to rejoin the game, you'll have
to wait 2 minutes, and then either START or RUN  the  game.   If
you  want  to exit the game temporarily (to answer SENDS, etc.),
type ^C (CTL-C), and you'll usually be able to CONTINUE.   NOTE:
If  you're  under  red alert, you won't be able to ^C out of the
game;  you'll have to use the QUIT command.
.


.RADIO
Turn sub-space RADIO on or off, or
set to ignore or restore communications from individual ships

Syntax:  RAdio ON|OFf  or  RAdio Gag|Ungag <ship name>

Turn your ship's sub-space radio on  or  off,  thus  controlling
whether  or  not you'll receive any messages from other ships or
your bases;  or suppress or restore  messages  originating  from
specific ships.

Examples:

RA ON           Turn sub-space radio ON.
RA OFF          Turn sub-space radio OFF.
RA G L          Suppress all radio messages sent by the
                Lexington.
RA U W          Allow radio messages sent by the Wolf to be
                received.
.


.REPAIR
REPAIR device damage

Syntax:  REpair [<units>]

Repair damaged ship devices.  If a ship suffers a  critical  hit
to  a  device,  REPAIR can be used to restore the device to full
(or partial) working order.   A  REPAIR  removes  the  specified
units  of  damage  from  each damaged device, in addition to the
normal repair rate of 30 units per turn.  If the ship is DOCKED,
the  pause  time  for the specified REPAIR is reduced by half of
that needed  while  in  flight.   If  the  repair  size  is  not
specified,  REPAIR  defaults to a 4 second repair (50 units + 50
more if docked).  REPAIR does NOT reduce the SHIP damage.

Examples:

.SCAN
Full range SCAN

Syntax:  SCan [Up|Down|Right|Left|Corner] [<range>|<vr><hr>] [W]

Display a selected portion of the nearby universe.  If no  range
is  specified,  SCAN  defaults  to  a  square  scan range of ten
sectors from the present ship location.  The keywords UP,  DOWN,
RIGHT,  LEFT, and CORNER modify this to include only the part of
this original square specified  (relative  to  the  ship).   The
maximum  scan  range  is 10 sectors, and larger specified ranges
are  reduced  to  this  value.   If  individual   vertical   and
horizontal  ranges  are  specified,  the  scanning field will be
shaped accordingly.  The WARNING keyword if added to the end  of
a  SCAN  command string will flag the empty sectors within range
of an enemy base or planet with !'s instead of  .'s.   The  SCAN
symbols and their meanings are:

L, N, S, V, Y   Federation warships
C, D, H, J, W   Empire warships
        ??        Romulan warship
        <>        Federation starbase
        )(        Empire starbase
         @        Neutral planet
        @F        Federation planet
        @E        Empire planet
         *        Star
                  Black hole
         .        Empty sector
         !        Empty sector within range of enemy port (only
                  when using WARNING keyword)

Examples:

  SC              Scan universe within a radius 10 sectors.
  SC 10           Equivalent to "SC".
  SC 13           Equivalent to "SC 10" or "SC".
  SC 4            Scan universe within 4 sectors.
  SC 4 4          Equivalent to "SC 4".
  SC 2 8          Scan up to 5 rows and 17 columns, centered on
                  the present ship location.
  SC U 4 7        Show only upper half of normal "SC 4 7" scan.
  SC C -5 -5      Scan the region bounded by the present ship
                  location and the location (-5,-5) sectors away
                  (puts ship in upper right corner of the scan).
  SC W            Same as "SC", plus shows danger zones around
                  enemy bases and planets.

.SUMMARY
Give SUMMARY on number of ships, bases, and planets

Syntax:  SUmmary [<keywords>]

Give any of the information available from the LIST command, but
give  only  a summary by default.  See the help on LIST for more
information and the complete set of keywords that can be used to
modify SUMMARY output.

Examples:

SUM             Tell how many ships, bases, and planets are in
                the game (broken down into friendly, enemy, and
                neutral categories).
SUM EN          Tell how many enemies are in the game (number of
                Romulans, enemy ships, enemy bases, and enemy
                planets).

.TARGETS

be  too time consuming.  List location and shield percent of any
enemy ship, base, or planet in range;  name of any enemy ship in
game  (including the Romulan);  or location and number of builds
of any known enemy planet.  TARGETS  is  equivalent  to  a  LIST
command with a default range of 10 sectors and a default side of
enemy.

Examples:

TA              List all targets within 10 sectors.

names>;<msg>

Send messages to one or several of the players currently in  the
game,  with  no range limitation.  Players who have turned their
radios off, or have a critically damaged sub-space radio can not
be  sent  to.   The  TELL  command can not be repeated using the
ESCAPE key (no junk mail!).

Examples:

TE V;Hello!     Send "Hello!" to the Vulcan.

game;   run  time for your job so far this game;  total run time
since login;  and current time of day.
.


.TORPEDOES
Fire photon TORPEDO burst

Syntax:
TOrpedo  [Absolute|Relative|Computed]   n   <v1><h1>   [<v2><h2>
[<v3><h3>]]

A photon torpedo is aimed along a path in physical  space,  thus
any  object  lying  along  its  path will intercept the torpedo.
One, two, or three torpedoes may be fired with one command,  and
the torpedoes may be individually targeted, or fired at a common
location.  The minimum range of a torpedo is 8 sectors, but some
will  travel  10 sectors before self-destructing.  Torpedoes may
be deflected from the desired track by  a  number  of  different
factors,  including  your  ship's  shield strength, computer and
torpedo tube damage, and torpedo misfires.   A  torpedo  misfire
also  aborts  the  remainder of the burst, and sometimes damages
the torpedo tubes as well.  Torpedoes  can  cause  stars  to  go
nova,  and  can  also destroy planets (if no enemy installations
remain intact).  "Accidental" hits on friendly ships, bases,  or
planets  are automatically neutralized.  A torpedo burst uses no
ship energy.  Firing torpedoes (or getting hit by one) puts  you
on red alert.

Examples:

TO 1 12 24        Fire one torpedo at sector 12-24.
TO 3 12 24        Fire three torpedoes at sector 12-24.
TO 3 6 7 8 7 9 12 Fire one torpedo at sector 6-7, one at 8-7,
                  and one at 9-12.
TO 3 12 24 13 39  Fire one torpedo at sector 12-24, and two at
                  sector 13-39.
TO A 3 12 24      Equivalent to "TO 3 12 24".
TO R 2 2 -5       Fire two torpedoes at sector 22-25, assuming
                  your location is 20-30.
TO C 3 BUZZARD    Fire three torpedoes at the Buzzard.
TO C 1 E          Fire one torpedo at the Excalibur.
.


.TRACTOR
TRACTOR beam

Syntax:  TRactor <ship name>  or  TRactor Off

Tow another ship of the  same  team.   The  two  ships  must  be
located  in  adjacent  sectors  and  both  ships must have their
shields lowered.  Once such a beam is applied, either  ship  can
pull  the other behind it using warp or impulse engines.  Energy
consumption for the towing ship is 3 times the normal  rate  for
movement  with  the shields down.  The ship being towed will end
the  move  trailing  the  lead  ship.   If  either  ship  raises
deflector  shields,  the tractor beam is automatically cut.  The
tractor beam will also be broken if either  ship  is  hit  by  a
torpedo or damaged by a nova.

Examples:

TR              Break any existing tractor beam.
TR OFF          Equivalent to "TR".
TR B            Apply tractor beam to the Buzzard.
.


.TYPE
TYPE game, input, and output settings

Syntax:  TYpe OPtion|OUtput

Type the current game OPTION and OUTPUT settings.
The OPTION settings are:
- The version number and date of implementation,
- Whether there are Romulans in the game,
- and whether there are Black Holes in the game.
The OUTPUT settings are:
- SHORT, MEDIUM, or LONG output,
- NORMAL or INFORMATIVE command prompt,
- SHORT or LONG sensor scans,
- ABSOLUTE or RELATIVE default for coordinate input,
- ABSOLUTE, RELATIVE, or BOTH for coordinate output,
- and the current TTYTYPE.

Examples:

TY OP           List the option settings.
TY OU           List the output settings.
.


.USERS
List USERS
Syntax:  Users

List all ships  currently  in  the  game.   Include  ship  name,
captain  (may  be  changed  by  SET  NAME),  TTY speed, PPN, TTY
number, and job number.  If the output format is set  to  medium
or short, omit the TTY and job numbers.  If the output format is
set to short, omit the TTY speed and PPN (include only the  ship
name and captain).
* If the password is set, you also get each ship's location.
