C	This routine is activated whenever any player (or the Romulan)
C	makes a time-consuming move.  It's purpose is to strengthen
C	weakened starbases of the opposite team.  The Romulan rebuilds
C	both side's starbases.  The percentage gain in base energy per
C	BASBLD call is reduced as the number of players increase.
