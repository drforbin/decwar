                       DECWAR Version 2.2, June 3, 1980
         DECWAR is a real time space battle game designed to be played  by
    from  1  to 18 people.  The object of the game is to destroy all enemy
    bases and ships, and capture all enemy planets, before the enemy  does
    the same to you.  Each person plays on a separate terminal, and enters
    the game by typing
                                 R GAM:DECWAR
    Players are free to enter and leave the game as  desired,  since  each
    has  his  own job and therefore won't interfere with the other players
    (the jobs interact through a shareable high segment).
         You get to select the ship you want to control  from  a  list  of
    remaining ships on your side.  There are 9 ships on each side:
                 Federation ships               Empire ships
