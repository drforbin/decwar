sorry some details must have gotten mixed up. the DEC-10 system was in louisville (UofL), administered by mark hittinger. the kentucky universities had an agreement to share computing resources. UK (lexington) had an IBM mainframe. the DEC-10 was way more fun and interesting so that‚Äôs what got me hooked. there was a microwave link to louisville (~80 miles). eric and i met when the DEC-10 was still operational. same for sean casey. the hang out was mcvey hall where most of the computing resources were located (the IBM 360 mainframe was in the basement, TVI910+ terminals on the first floor). the DEC-10 shut down in 1985 if i recall. i think eric graduated by then. when the DEC-10 shut down, i started using local unix systems. labs popped up around the UK campus. one of those was with math sciences, a joint venture of the mathematics, statistics, and computer sciences departments. math sciences went the unix route which made sense as that‚Äôs where all the innovations were. (separate note - the mcvey folks stuck to their overpriced and useless IBM mainframe and fell behind the times). i met bill stoll, david herron, etc at math sciences, likely because sean moved to those unix systems and introduced them to me. bill wrote uniwar while at math sciences. i really am not aware of any connection with utexas. maybe mark hittinger had one, but i never even saw the DEC-10. i was just a remote user, and unauthorized for most of my time on that system so i was in the fringe as far as knowing details of how that system was operated by mark. 

ahha!!! ok, wasn't understanding meaning of UK - that helps! just meant decwar had spread from utexas up to that area and become uniwar there - seems like a cool part of the history!:) and the most fun part is that eric learned about it up there and then later arrived in austin and started working on decwar without knowing that was the starting point - it's really a fun kinda 'loop':)(Edited)

nicely 'packaged' for 'everyone', especially students, both authentic old decwar and state of the art new decwar - both old and new together, side by side - and here's the thing - to have ai 'agents' as part of the package so no-one ever again sees the game 'alone' - they always see a rousing battle, albeit ai agents - and then we're brainstorming doing some things with that in austin at the least - installation with cool audio and visual 'space' for people to explore and get hands on, and see some of the history of the whole saga - photos etc(Edited) celebration of everything around decwar and that eraüëç

Joel, for me this started as an exercising in thinking about what my students are going to do next fall. They are beginning/intermediate programmers and we do a lot of retro game reverse engineering and recreating.  I went down a text only path and that reminded me of you and Decwar years ago.  So I started looking in that direction, which led me to Harris Newman, who has been very helpful.  I decided in about a day this was way too much for my students, but I was already hooked on coding it (just as a personal challenge).  I also thought if they had a running system we could easily instrument they could do some cool graphics and sound around a running game.

In a totally coincidental side thread, I'd seen (nothing to do with decwar) that PiPD-10 work and asked my wife to get me one for my birthday.  That led to a posting by Noah in the PiDP-10 forum about a week after I'd started the port (which was kind mind blowing synchronicity) and then without asking Harris introduced me to Noah.
We also have an annual student/dept showcase in nov, so we are doing some thinking around that with Mk Haley, who is at UT and a former Disney Imagineer. Also a possible Siggraph event in 2026. This is literally a project that seems to be writing its own script as we go. Joel, I graduated in 88 I believe ,but had probably moved on to the AT&T unix lab and no longer visited McVey much (I think). then at Bloomington for 2 years, then Yale

my dad‚Äôs DEC-10 account with the sociology department had been shut down for quite some time already.  so you have to wonder - what did he think i was doing at mcvey 20 hours at a time?
the real problems came later when i couldn‚Äôt show my face in mcvey anymore and dialed in over modem straight to louisville.
the accounts were segregated.  louisville accounts could not login on the TTYs associated with the microwave lines from lexington.  there were probably two orders of magnitude more potential accounts in the louisville pool to hack.
so i had to dial long distance to louisville.  strangely in state long distance cost more than calling to the next state.  some weird regulation or lack of regulation in the state, not sure.
so there was some of that phone stuff.  you do that long enough from your home phone‚Ä¶
long story short, a kind person in louisville tipped me when the FBI started making calls to the UofL university administrators.
jakydude ‚Äî 23:10
the local unix labs were the next targets
i was easy to spot.  those systems couldn‚Äôt support many users.  ultimately the folks at math sciences asked me to come into the office for a talk.  they said they would just give me an account if i would stop breaking into other people‚Äôs accounts.  then they could keep an eye on me.  worked for me.  and then i became a convert from black hat to white hat.
that‚Äôs pretty much it
by the time i started school at UK, the math sciences folks created an RA position for me and i became part of the staff.  to keep out hackers and run their systems.  it paid my way through school. 
if UofL really wanted to make an example of me, they probably could have.  but i disappeared.  and there weren‚Äôt many laws on the books back then.  cyber crimes were still a new thing.
i have a really interesting story for some future time - very confidential emails concerning staff, students, and faculty were mysteriously being found on all the local printers.
so the assumption was someone with a grudge was hacking root access, reading people‚Äôs email, and then spooling anything they didn‚Äôt like so it would cause a big fuss.
it was a really interesting two months where i systematically tracked down the person and then logged all of their behavior so the school admins could take action

joel what was the situation with arpanet there? was it available at all? for me i doubt it was in san marcos, but austin had an early imp - it's on the deservedly famous map 
another even more obscure part of the story is the aerospace parts in the seventies and eighties - would like to explore that - this stuff is way more interesting than the usual 'personal computers' fare, for me - and the ai strands eric 
so for the austin story - ai natural language, bob taylor from utexas to arpa, super star trek, mcdonald and apollo, transit, antartica, gravity mapping, subs, oil exploration, lunar laser ranging, gps, arpanet, imp, pdp10, decwar, csr, cray, mcc, lisp machines, seasat, topex poseidon, hipparcos, hubble, grace, icesat, gsfc, jpl, ucboulder, lasp, nist

I was on usenet (alt.sys.pdp10) in the early 90's searching, pleading for
someone to release the code.  I at that time used sdf.org for email.  (If
you don't know about sdf.org, it's out of San Antonio, and is a bunch of
unix servers that are exposed to the internet.  He runs several pdp-10
simulations on it as well, which you can get access to for free.  I got a
lifetime membership for like $35 and still use it!).

I got an email around 1995 with a large mime attachment with the source
code on sdf.org.  I am sure I got it around then because I remember other
things that set that year (I was married to my 1st wife then, etc).

I normally keep my old emails (esp so important as this one), but I can't
find it now (I looked multiple times on sdf.org too).  I had a ton of cd's
and floppies with it backed up that I went through last week but none have
the original email.   I moved from Round Rock to Portland Oregon 4 years
ago and during that time we downsized multiple times and most of my
floppies/cd's are gone.

I had no way to distribute the code until I came across the Dolph Briscoe
Center for American History, and in 2011 and arranged for the return of the
code to UT, for distribution.

It's frustrating to me that I can't find that email.  I'm going to continue
looking, but I am losing faith that I can find it.  Those floppies I
had...I am so frustrated that I didn't keep them.

I do have emails of who I talked with at the Briscoe center, it was Zach
Vowell,
Hope this helps,  So, when can we play a game?

Noah ‚Äî 00:19
so after sleeping on it a bit, realized we should update joel - we got a beautiful reply from harris today. here's a nutshell -
harris was on alt.sys.pdp-10 in the early nineties, hunting for decwar source code - i was lurking there too and suspect i remember this 
in 1995 somebody sent harris an email with the compuserve source code attached
that original email is now lost and we don't know who the sender was 
to add one additional fact, merlyn got the compuserve code from harris and around 2012 did some intense hacking and got it to run on simh pdp-10. he put that on github at that time. merlyn has said he was using ddt debugger to accomplish that - it was a major achievement. 
with project utexas, roughly april and may this year we set out to start from the compuserve code and go backwards, to converge back on the utexas original and to make it more easily usable by more people. and now here we are 

jakydude ‚Äî 08:06
wow that‚Äôs all so cool
so ‚Äúhe put that on github at that time‚Äù means it is on github?  the version you started with?  or it was put and then lost?

Noah ‚Äî 08:14
yep the github repo drforbin decwar is the compuserve code that merlyn got from harris and debugged in 2012.
for a little more detail about that compuserve code - it is essentially the tape that utexas sent to compuserve in 1982
compuserve added a few things, and modified a few things - but the skeleton is all there - pure 'utexas tape'
so what we're doing now in 'the utexas folder' is washing out the compuserve impurities - we want it to look, taste, smell and feel like the original utexas tape - and everyone to be able to easily use it on their raspi
and the dream is - if we can recover a real life physical original utexas tape - it will match up closely with our 'utexas23-reconstruction' 
this is all what we mean by going 'backwards in time'
it's fun, and not impossible - the key thing is that our starting point is actually close to the destination - the compuserve impurities are pretty minor - cosmetics basically 

20250608

this is fun - hit some kinda milestone - 
have multiple 'agents' telnetting in from laptop and 'playing the game'!
it's alive!!!
the agents are super brainless - just randomly moving around üòÑ 
but they create a 'game loop' and drive the action - the romulan is jumping in and creating some mayhemüòÑ
not even going to begin thinking about adding brains to the agents, aka 'machine learning training em', yet - for this weekend will just add fun things like look for targets, and auto attack if anything's in rangeüôÇ
wow, brainstorm - will put a cli on the agent code and have a shell script start a few agents on each side
will start creating personalities for some of them already - dialog for them to send over the radio
Eric ‚Äî 00:40
cool
Noah ‚Äî 00:41
a memory came back - back in the day, had just seen blade runner
would play as 'batty' and radio stuff like 'fiery the angels fell' etc
Eric ‚Äî 00:42
i worked in a movie theater when Bladerunner came out
Noah ‚Äî 00:42
batty will ride again this weekend!
Eric ‚Äî 00:42
very fun to watch reactions of people leaving after the movie
Noah ‚Äî 00:43
can have some fun star trek personalities too - scotty lives!
and bones mccoy;)
he's dead, jim:)

looking at eric's folder listing, here's a fun historical note - compuserve had each command as a separate file - so torpedo, tractor, tell, etc - merlyn worked on and debugged that compuserve code from 2011/2012 onward - makes tons of sense and totally natural, no problemo 
then the pidp-10 came out around a year ago -
my first thought was of course 'hey, let's get that github decwar going, it uses simh so can go on raspi and pidp-10'...! 
so i started looking more and more intently at that big pile of files there in the github repo - what you see in the root of the main branch is the starting point - simply a huge pile of files, unstructured, no signals what really matters and what not - 99.99% that this is exactly what merlyn got from harris around 2011, and what harris received as an email attachment in 1995 (what's there in the root has been debugged enough by merlyn, it was my starting point and was able to build and run it pretty quickly) 
now, here's the first exciting discovery - sometime last fall? 
first this one https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.IMP - and then https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.TAP and https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/blob/master/utexas/utexas23-reconstruction/hlp/DECWAR.LTR 
Noah ‚Äî 07:13
as i studied these, there were the very first glimmers of 'project utexas'  in the old brain - 'ahha, there's deeper layers of archeology here!' üòç
this's how 'project utexas' and the concept of 'going backwards' were born - it's been a complete and total surprise, and has really evolved from zero - there was nothing this time last year - it took a loooooooong time for all the puzzle pieces to fit together and understandings to grow - latest big breakthroughs were very recent, april and early may, right around when eric and me first met! 
Noah ‚Äî 08:11
i'd say, fully formed concept was there around christmas - begin telling merlyn about it there over the holidays, and he was rightfully skeptical - call with merlyn in april was when flat out declared, it's happenin, and he blessed it all with 'will be happy to see it in action'. btw fwiw merlyn's working in the 'development' branch - that's where he has his 'cloaking device' code going. 
he's done really cool and fun stuff there - the way it works is, if you build on a planet, there's a probability your science officer will say 'sir, we've discovered an ancient ruin with cloaking technology' - you then get the ability to cloak

Where did you and Merlyn meet?
I'd seen some references to normal ships cloaking and wonder what the story was
Noah ‚Äî 17:22
purely through the github repo - roughly a year ago - once i was able to run the compuserve code there in the repo, on top of simh pdp10 tops10, confirming it was all legit, contacted merlyn to discuss directly üëç
ar first, it was purely to try to figure out what the heck was going on in that code and what the big pic story with utexas and compuserve wasüòÑ
needless to say, it was very confusing understanding the roles of harris and merlyn, on top of everything elseüòÑ
Eric ‚Äî 19:10
what were their roles with respect to the two original developers
finally back together:
Image
refactored but i had to touch way too much code (converted from (x,y) to (v,h) for one thing.  To quote another movie, I bet it has more bugs than a bait store.
Noah ‚Äî 21:36
looks good! agents are much more robust now - they've been playing for many hours now - going to start a little personality now just for fun - we have monday off here
they have not been in direct  contact with the two developers - what shannon mentioned with briscoe speaking to bob is the only contact i'm aware of - pretty special!üëç
Eric ‚Äî 21:40
Oh did she say they'd actually spoken?
Noah ‚Äî 21:43
yep, something like 'briscoe did contact bob, and he stated he doesn't have any source code' - not too surprising - q is if he has any clues towards places that would have tapes;)
Eric ‚Äî 21:45
oh okay
he's the JP Morgan VP?
Noah ‚Äî 21:45
yep, chicago guy
Eric ‚Äî 21:46
So is pretty much nothing known about why this game was created or exactly in what org at UT?
Noah ‚Äî 21:49
well, because of those earlier single player versions - there was some kind of 'community' at utexas, and it seems to have had ties to the cc. and cs and ee? this is a part i'd like to explore
and note eric raymond states he has worked with one of the utexas 'super star trek' devs - so there is more out there to learn, for sure!
this is why i say, for some library school grad student - their dissertation would write itselfüòÄ
between like 73 and 83 something very special happened at utexas
Noah ‚Äî 21:59
as project utexas goes backwards in time, at some point it will bump into the two player 'war' on the cdc6600 and the single player 'super star trek' - all right there in the cc - the hardware was definitely big iron in the cc 
Eric ‚Äî 22:03
yea i need to check out those precursors
Noah ‚Äî 22:06
yep, the story gets extremely complicated there, but the utexas fortran 'super star trek' seems to be the root genetics throughout
so we know of like five to ten descendants of decwar - seems to be like a factor of ten more descendants of super star treküòÆ
Eric ‚Äî 22:34
have you tried to talk to any of those folks
Noah ‚Äî 22:39
not yet:) would love to know more and looking forward to it - just taking one baby step at a time, always 'backwards', hahaha

excellent read - good author - real cs guy, and can write
Eric ‚Äî 00:09
i see his BASIC book too
okay we were debating how a game ends, here's the definitive way in your ut source code:

This routine is called whenever a base or planet is destroyed
C    to see if the game is over. (all the planets gone, and one
C    side's bases).  If so, the appropriate message is printed out
C    and the job is returned to monitor level.

Note I don't think this rules out a tie.
Noah ‚Äî 00:12
looks like the real answer right there -
Eric ‚Äî 00:12
yea
and makes sense
Noah ‚Äî 00:13
yep totally agree - 'get the planets and bases'


ok! good news - the three amigos have run nicely for over six hours! no obvious bugs for them, at least ‚ù§Ô∏è

All devices functional.
let me try to get a little damage...
ahha! boom - memory bug right away

Eric ‚Äî 06:19
wow
Noah ‚Äî 06:19
it was bringing in this fourth ship - from a normal interactive terminal session
saw something similar a couple times yesterday about the 'Q' - at least that's one clue
ok, well this is probly telling us something, good to know üëç
after going for six hours with three players of the same type - bringing in a fourth player of a slightly different type was a prob for 'the Q'
Hmm the Q wasn‚Äôt even a thing yet was it in this timeframe
Noah ‚Äî 06:29
think it's just shorthand for queue - there's definitely a 'command queue' - hmmm, wonder if it concerns the 'timing topics' eric?
could be of interest
real quick before i forget - note to self! there was also something odd with tops10, before entering the game - had to login as decwar, not demo - file permissions were wrong for demo, which shouldn't have been true, at all?

will be studying warmac a bit more today - try to get an overview
Noah ‚Äî Yesterday at 12:18
funny, feeling is that in just the few days since agent was 'invented' had been getting a valid feel for the boundaries of the problem / challenge - nutshell - three agents good, four agents bad! four seems to be a bridge too far 
and now with more stress testing those questions about tty / telnet are growing - evidence seems to be piling up that problem is in i/o and the tty situation - have noticed some more curious things this morning! üòÑ  so, with old school we're on the path, climbn the mountain üëç 
Noah ‚Äî Yesterday at 12:40
fwiw btw, suspect merlyn wouldn't have seen this stuff since he probly didn't have many 'ships in the game' simultaneously - doubt he had anything like 'agents' - will discuss with him next time it makes sense - meanwhile, still lots to learn 'beginners brain' style ü§î

three hours of brainless mayhem with seven ships - we got it! radio does seem to need a fix - but that's a separate topic üôÇ
Image
Eric ‚Äî Yesterday at 21:32
what's the radio do
Noah ‚Äî Yesterday at 22:18
radio was just lazy way of saying 'tell' - nomad is doing 'tell all' and that should be received by six ships, not four as in the pic
Eric ‚Äî 01:55
as long as radio on
and not radio damaged
Noah ‚Äî 03:35
ahha, woke up with a guess what's happening - picture the 'usual list' of ships - fed then emp
the ships with radio trouble are at the bottom of the list!
betcha a tribble the first ten ships are ok and the last eight are not ok
there's a cis value of 10 somewhere that needs changing 18
Eric ‚Äî 03:38
see if they have radio damage as well, that will defeat
Noah ‚Äî 03:38
their silly ten ships again!
shoooould be able to hunt this down quickly, another cis thing to be 'reconstructed' backwards to utexas:)
they enter the game with radio silence - brand new ship, cant send or receive
but nothing worse - everything else seems ok, but radio silence
Noah ‚Äî 03:47
never mind! shot that theory down already
just joined game as wolf - it can send!
but not receive... ok may be something to the theory - but just for receive, send is ok 
running eight hours now, eight ships - ahhh it's really nice to see - we're in really good shape - can start evolving the agent:)
Noah ‚Äî 04:14
argh, really shot the theory down now - no good idea yet why some ships have a prob sendingü§î
this could be a 'fun' bug hunt
Eric ‚Äî 05:46
hmm so some ships can receive radio but some aren't?
Noah ‚Äî 06:06
it's confusing - sorry for thinking our loud hereüòÑ  for many ships the radio is fine - for a few, can receive but not send - and for a few, can do neither - very confusing situation - main thing is, there's def a bug in the radioüëç
Eric ‚Äî 06:07
ah yea seems there are some bugs in there
Noah ‚Äî 06:07
it's only annoying, kind of an edge case - but wanna stomp it

yeah i recognize his name - let's find out how he connects with esr - the potential problem with esr is he's such a militant unix fanboyü§î 
and with the single player stuff, especially the basic stuff, there's a loooooot of people - have seen some off-putting arguments about who did what first over there
Eric ‚Äî 06:33
the text game is interesting
Noah ‚Äî 06:34
i really wonder if i played it - am 95% certain i messed with it for like five minutes - early or mid eighties
messed with several versions of the single player game, but never got into it
decwar was just in a completely different universeüòç
Eric ‚Äî 07:52
okay, the refactored version i think is very buggy, but it is up
http://decwarjs.com/ or telnet decwarjs.com
no idea how well the browser verrsion works, haven't played with it much
now seeing this on pdp: 

 Command: points all
Too many words -- line ignored
Noah ‚Äî 09:18
awesome! will play with it later today üëç
weird - old school has been running non stop here with eight ships
after adding that line, didja restart simh - boot from disk.ini ?ü§î

ah i missed something
cad - not cadr!
Mk ‚Äî 09:33
Nope. I forgot I made a 10 foot by 10 foot architectural plan
Noah ‚Äî 09:34
sorry - i was just reading about lisp machines and was stuck in my brain!
roughly what type of machine are ya using in the pics?üòÄ 
Mk ‚Äî 09:44
Trying to remember..  it was donated.. had a fax 11/780 in grad school.. but this machine was cad only
Fax. Ha. I said what I said autocorrect! Vax

Noah ‚Äî 09:49
awesome!!!
Mk ‚Äî 09:50
Course my classes were in coins ( that‚Äôs what they called computer science) math, electrical engineering, had to take differential equations at smith college, and large scale welding to understand 3 dimensions
Noah ‚Äî 09:51
have ya written some of your story down? should do! all three of us should üôÇ

Noah ‚Äî 09:56
nice!!!
the mashup of art school and computers is really interesting topic - should def do something with that, history wise ü§î
Mk ‚Äî 10:02
Copper Giloth made it happen. She‚Äôs got a show of her work in Paris right now.. so some histiry right there.
Noah ‚Äî 10:03
cool - will google it! üëç
Mk ‚Äî 10:03
Patric prince used to chair the siggraph traveling aet show and many artists just said ‚Äúkeep it‚Äù rather than pay to ship it home. So that‚Äôs another collection
And Jacki Morie just got a lifetime award from VES
She dud some of the earliest VR art stuff
Noah ‚Äî 10:05

there ya go - flat out memory error
major bug in the code somewhere...ü§î
PC is program counter register - total system crash 
the code that went on the tape in step3 has a bug for sure
Eric ‚Äî 00:35
restarted fine, still seeing that collision stuff
Noah ‚Äî 00:48
so simh is working ok? and in tops10 when you run decwar it crashes with memory error?ü§î
if so, could go to a safe git commit
confirm decwar runs ok at that commit
then look for what went wrong in the following commits?ü§î
Eric ‚Äî 01:01
well i can play a bit bfore it crashes, the garbage output happens around collisions

want to learn what your git situation is - if we can get you on a know good commit

oh i've just been downloading straight
can do whatever
Noah ‚Äî 01:13
wondering if you have this latest commit - if we can be in sync via git, we'd know for sure what code is running ü§î
definitely should not be seeing those memory error crashes - those are veeeery surprisingü§î
Eric ‚Äî 01:16
i just did a straight download from github, should be
Noah ‚Äî 01:18
ok, hmmm. stumped... game is running fine here - six hours straight now...
hmmm....
just a sec, checking something...
ahha - possible idea!
Noah ‚Äî 01:26
ok, just now pushed this commit to drforbin/decwar https://github.com/drforbin/decwar/commit/ca0070f4a4d24a7c3631d18a05c39542c046bfec
it has some little mods to simh scripts - nothing major

Noah ‚Äî 01:27
ok, shouldn't be happening...:(
this is the new simh line that i wonder if it could help - it's possible...
expect "\r\n." send "del *.sta\r"; continue
you'll see it in the new commit
what that does is delete the on disk game state - that's what the .sta file is
i added that within the last week because have a suspicion that file can get corrupted
and that once it's corrupt, it can totally crash and ruin the game
just a suspicion / feel - but worth a try
it's at least remotely possible it's literally causing the crashes you're having...ü§î
corrupt game state coming from that decwar.sta file...
Noah ‚Äî 01:42
geez, getting hopeful actually... you can do it manually as well - on tops10 be logged in as decwar - then just do command 'del *.sta' - clear that old game state, right before starting the game - fresh new decwar üôÇ 
bout a week ago, i might have been in the same kinda 'doom loop' your in right now - that's why i started deleting that state file...
if this cures your decwar - we'll have learned something big here...:)

hmmm, so not getting booted into tops10 at all anymore? of the two probs (booting tops10, running decwar), seems like booting tops10 is the worse one? ü§î
Noah ‚Äî 05:21
thinking out loud here - just brainstorming - and purely about prob1, booting tops20, not prob2 
so dec10blinken is a simh exe built on my raspi - could try the plain vanilla one called just 'dec10' there just to see if it does better, but it's not the real answer for us
well maybe it is, at least it can't conflict with pidp package - should be safe in that regard
but bigger pic is may need to move on to building dec10blinken locally, local build instead of my pre canned exes...
Noah ‚Äî 05:28
will find the link for that this morning - it's not hard at all, just wanted to avoid it if possible:)
will need to create expanded instructions to help guide people who encounter this situationü§î
Eric ‚Äî 05:31
oh i can get it to work, just take a couple times
Noah ‚Äî 05:32
should start working on those this morning as well - really? that's good news then!
i was thinking was totally blocked kinda
need better instructions though for sure - things aren't as simple as i wanted and hoped - will start on those this morning, somewhere where you can edit and add...
is there some kinda cloud thing you'd go for? github or gitlab could both work... or even here in discord, am new to discord so not sure?

notes to self - three links that have to be the core of utexas user guide 
most essential - fundamental - https://github.com/rcornwell/sims
on top of previous, for the software side - https://sky-visions.com/dec/tops10.shtml
and for broader context, perspective surrounding utexas - https://github.com/obsolescence/pidp10
these three can be skeleton for expanded utexas user guide

I looked on the Texas Scholarworks for the item I gave to UT in 2011, and now it only has 1 file and it's a license:
https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/items/e0e0aa09-2dc3-49c5-a919-19210d7916d3

So I went back in time to my emails to Zach about it and found my submission, and although gmail won't easily let me download it, (file type no longer allowed to be sent), I was able to recover it.   I have uploaded it to the internet archive here: https://archive.org/details/decwar-2.3.tar and that should keep it for history.  

In that email I had Bob Hysick's response to Zach concerning decwar's release.  Here is his response:
"I'd be happy to have Decwar included in the Archive.  I would also be interested in obtaining a copy of the source ‚Äì anything I had was lost in a purge years ago strongly encouraged by my wife.  (The bulk of the source was an assembler program.  The remainder was Fortran.  There was also a user‚Äôs guide, though I don‚Äôt recall its format.)
 
Your call made me curious, so I checked the web for Decwar references.  I found some interesting information in a Wikipedia Decwar entry.  That page and referenced pages included details I had forgotten or wasn‚Äôt aware of.  But they were short on development history and attribution to the authors.
 
The precursor to Decwar was a game written, I believe, by Jeff Potter and an author whose name I don‚Äôt recall (Robert something, perhaps).  It was a turn-based game that we played on teletypes (there‚Äôs some ancient history for you!).  The Web told me that game was called War, something I didn‚Äôt remember.
 
That was the late 70‚Äôs, the time when programming on campus was still largely done with punch cards.  It was the time of Adventure and Zork, the early text-based adventure games that were the inspiration for the likes of Leisure Suit Larry, King‚Äôs Quest, and ultimately games like Myst (in fact, I think I recall a Zork reference in Myst).
 
We wanted to take War to the next level: make it real time, improve the interface, increase the number of players, make a number of core game changes, and generally transform and improve game play.  And so, in our spare time between classes and work, we began our task (who needs sleep anyway?).  I worked for the Computation Center on the DEC-10, so I had access to the necessary resources, including a much-coveted 9600 baud CRT.  I took on the task of writing the core in assembler, while Jeff worked on the Fortran component.  Writing in assembler was necessary for much of the low-level access we required, and it allowed for optimizing both CPU and memory use (both were precious resources, especially in the  day when we actually used magnetic core memory).  Besides, back then assembler was the predominant system programming language, and language choices were limited, so it was a natural choice.
 
Over time we accomplished our  goal, producing a number of versions of Decwar.  We spent many late nights in the depths of space, exploring the galaxy and battling foes with futuristic weapons.  It wasn‚Äôt much by today‚Äôs standards, but back then (more than 30 years ago now!) it was quite an accomplishment."

harris, this is fantastic!!!:) thank you! comments directly from bob hysick - beautiful!:)

have to process this - it's a huge step forward!:) yes we definitely would like to establish contact with bob - we've been thinking that briscoe can help with that. any way we can do that will be great!

and thanks for that link harris - briscoe mentioned that they have three catalog items, and we knew about two - this is the third one! - here are all three together!
