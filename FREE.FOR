C	This routine is called whenever a player dies, quits the game,
C	or temporarily CTL-C's out.  The appropriate parts of the high
C	segment are saved in the low segment, and zeroed out for use by
C	others.  If a restart is made after a ^C, the information is
C	passed back up into the high segment, and the player is again
C	active.  Any hit or radio messages present before the ^C
C	will be lost.
