C	This routine is used to capture neutral or enemy planets.
C	Player must be adjacent to planet specified (in 'orbit').
C	If a planet has been fortified by the enemy (using the BUILD
C	command), the pause time is increased 1 second and the
C	attacking ship's energy is reduced 50 units for each BUILD.
